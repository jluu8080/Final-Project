# Final-Project
PLEASE!
1. Add Comments so we can understand what you're doing.

2. Let us know what files or features you're working on, so we don't make the same thing or cause a MERGE Conflict when pushing to main.

3. Document what you're doing, to look good for teacher and peer review later. 

4. If you need help, just ask :)
